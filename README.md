This document describes the process to build the fake-server-app project and execute the functional and the performance tests.

To run the test suite you need docker client (ie. Docker Desktop), Python3, K6 test framework and allure framework for the report of reults.
During the test setup, the script automatically raises the container , runs the tests using the pytest module and saves the logs internally. After completion a container teardown is initiated where the container and all relevant processes are killed.


Functional Test Suite Steps
1. Build docker image docker build -t fake-server-app .
2. Change directory to tests
3. Run with python   python3 -m pytest functional --alluredir=/tmp/my_allure_results
4. To see the allure results in your browser you can execute the following command allure serve /tmp/my_allure_results.

Performance Test Suite Steps
1. Raise docker container with the following command: docker run -d -p 5001:5000 fake-server-app
2. Change directory to tests/performance
3. Execute the command: k6 run load_test.js --out csv=test_results.csv
4. Kill the container.
5. Results are stores in test.csv file.
6. Run puthon3 standard_deviation.py to take the standard deviation.
